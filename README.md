# **Sentiment Analysis and Correlation Study between Reddit Comments and PubMed Articles**

This project aims to explore the potential correlation between the sentiments expressed in Reddit comments and PubMed articles over the period of 2010 to 2024. We employ the **VADER** library for sentiment analysis and perform a **Pearson correlation test** to analyze the data.

## **Key Features**
- **Data Scraping**: Extract Reddit comments and PubMed articles.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Utilize the **VADER** library to determine the sentiment scores of the scraped data.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Perform **Pearson correlation tests** to evaluate the relationship between the sentiment trends in Reddit comments and PubMed articles.

## **Results**
1. **2010-2024 Analysis**:
   - **Correlation Test**: No significant correlation found.
   - **Observation**: Limited Reddit comments from 2010-2013 may have contributed to the sharp fluctuations observed in the sentiment data.

2. **2014-2024 Analysis**:
   - **Correlation Test**: Small positive correlation detected, but it is not statistically significant.

## **Conclusion**
The study indicates that while there is a slight positive trend in sentiment correlation between Reddit comments and PubMed articles from 2014-2024, the correlation is not strong enough to be considered significant. The initial lack of data from 2010-2013 suggests that a more extensive dataset could potentially alter these findings.

## **Tools and Libraries**
- **Python**: Main programming language used.
- **VADER**: For sentiment analysis.
- **Pearson Correlation Test**: To evaluate the correlation between datasets.
